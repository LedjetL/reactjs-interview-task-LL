To run the app there is nothing complicated to do.
Simply open,download the files and run terminal by typing :
npm start
Afterwards the app should open in web and all the necessary functionalities are displayed.
Simply enter your category that you want to include and then just create notes and edit the notes to your personal preferences.
There is also the option to delete category,search,edit note,delete note.
The data are stored in firebase.

Relating to the task please add answers to the following questions;
How might you make this app more secure?
How would you make this solution scale to millions of records?

To make the app more secure I would use the most popular ways of protection:
1.Using HTTPS to encrypt data that are transmitted between the client and server.
2.Using anti CSRF tokens that would protect the website by filtering and only accepting legit requests.
3.Validation which is quite crucial to prevent injection attacks in XSS or SQL.
4.Api Security
5.Keeping everything up to date.
6.Having a security plan to respond when the attack might happen.So measures that will help you in the worst case.

    Making this solution scale to millions of records:
        1.Firstly it is necessary to deliver a better code more structured and more refined.
        2.Database needs to be optimized so it carries large datasets
        3.Load balancers for traffic.
        4.Cloud services since almost everything is migrating to Cloud
        5.Content Compression

    Now this part is my personal idea of giving to ideally make the website better and increase the revenue it will produce.It may be off topic but there's always room for improvment in any field.

        1.Marketing the app.Marketing is fristly the most important first step you should take when you promote something.
        2.The app needs to be unique and provide everything that is necessary for the clients.
        3.Instead of a simple note app i'd suggest adding a AI so it would help the persons to add reminders and the app would ping them by the necessary time.Working out,skin routines,meditating and such things.
        4.The app would also be a help on mental awareness since most of the people suffer from stress it would e a tracker of your mood so you would be having a journal of how your emotions have affected your day.
        5.To do list as the app actually is but making it more integrated and more automatic.
        6.And to sum it up group notes.It would be helpful in projects and lots of task to be completed and also an option to check the tasks that are done.
